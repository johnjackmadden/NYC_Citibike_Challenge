# NYC_Citibike_Challenge
## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis was to introduce the Tableau workspace and to learn how to create visulatizaions, dashboards, and stories within the software to display and interpret a set of data to draw meaningful conclussions from a real-world data set
## Results
### Duation: As seen in the visualization below, the most common trip length for someone checking out a citi-bike is about 5 minutes, and would very rarely elapse over 1 hour. This allows us to interpret that this is primaraly for short-term transportation, making this a service more comparable to the Bird/LYFT scooters that are also prevenant in most cities these days. This service is for short term transportation, compared to a different possible use, like tourism to visit various locations around the city

### This point can also be supported by looking at a heat map for the most common checkout times for bikes, where checkout times during the weekdays are most popular from 7-9 AM and from 5-7 PM, which line up with a typical workday for the average person. Also, the weekend seem to have a more uniform distribution of checkout times, so while people still utalize the service outside of transportation during the work week, there is still a decent amount of use for more general transportation (Errands, entertainment, etc)

### Gender: There is an significantly higher amount of men using the Citi-bike service compared to women, as seen in the graph below:

### This also supports my theory people use this service primarily for communiting to work, as the heatmap below shows a large amount of men use the service at the commuting hours of 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM

### Subscription: There seem to be a large amount of people using this service as a part of a subscription, which supports my theory that this is a service for short term transportation for residents, compared to a service for tourist to visit the city with, as seen in the visulization below:

## Summary
### In summary, the average person who uses Citi-Bike is male, uses the service for around 5-10 minutes, and does so during the communting hours of the work week. If we want to continue to grow the business, focusing on these areas seem to be the most fruitful areas that we are currently doing well in, like continuing to build the subscription based model of the business.
